# Hanual language

The hanual langauge is a programming language created by two CS (Computer Science) students. The language aims to fill the gap of a cross platform low level language.

```
fn main() {
    println("Hello world")
    // I am a comment
    /* I am a multiline comment */
}
```

The language aims to be simple and cut out unnecessery abstractions like classes. And stay quite "down to earth" with it's syntax.
